The final papaer was edited on Overleaf, and u can find it here:
https://www.overleaf.com/project/609f9d3cc83411604900db7c
An edit request shall be needed.

The dataset we used here was from the following website link:
http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/
You will need to download the .tar files and then unzip them to read all the emails in .txt format.
There are about 33K of them in the preprocessed version.

The code for non-nn part is in the .py file. It includes the hyperparameter tuning part.
The code for LSTM part is in the ,ipynb file.

Hope it helps:)
